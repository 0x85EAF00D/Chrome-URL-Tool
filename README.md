# Chrome-URL-Reinstater
This script will read a text file that was created from the Chrome-URL-Saver script and open a new Chrome window loading all URLs in the file back into the Chrome window. 

Note the text file which contains the URLs needs to be opened before and stay open throughout running this script.
The TextEdit window containing the URLs also needs to be the front-most windows out of the other TextEdit windows open.
